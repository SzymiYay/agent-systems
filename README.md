## Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to the project, explaining the importance of studying disease spread and how agent-based modeling can be used for this purpose.

## Objectives
- To simulate the spread of a disease in a population.
- To analyze the impact of different parameters on disease propagation.
- To visualize the results in an intuitive and informative manner.

## Methodology
Describe the approach taken to model the disease spread, including:
- The agent-based modeling framework used.
- The parameters considered (e.g., infection rate, recovery rate, population density).
- The simulation environment and tools.

## Requirements
List the software and libraries required to run the project, such as:
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Any other relevant libraries

## Installation
Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project environment:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-systems-disease-spread.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd agent-systems

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Explain how to run the simulation and visualize the results:
```bash
# Run the simulation
python src/main.py

```

## Results
Present the results of the simulation, including graphs and charts that illustrate the spread of the disease under different scenarios.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings of the project and discuss potential improvements or future work.

## References
List any references or resources used in the project.
